Upon opening up you can ask Echo to list the sounds however she reads them so fast it can be difficult to keep track. I've compiled that full list below as of March 17, 2017. This skill needs some work as once you open it you need to issue it the direct name of the sound you want immediately it asks \"What can I do for you?\".

If you're willing to sit through all these sales pitches, you might find this app to be useful. If you are simply looking for the sounds (like it used to play without an upfront sales pitch), then you might want to rethink it.

It even says the original content would be free to the original users but nevertheless I get the message that the sound I have been listening to for weeks is now premium only.  Well I decide the promotional lifetime membership is worth it so I shell out the fifteen bucks and follow the instructions to register.  But then nothing happened.  I'm out $15 and don't even get what I paid for!  Used to be a good app and would even be worth the money, but as is it is a total rip off.  Will be emailing the developer for a refund.

And it's not your typical sappy nature noises. I was over the moon when she mentioned oscillating fan.

They work well to calm a busy mind that is supposed to be going to sleep but can't. I've listened to a lot of sleep sound programs over the years because I like them for relaxation, so I know the difference between those that induce relaxation and those that are inadvertently \"too busy\", or which aren't looped smoothly, and become annoying instead.

This is what I have needed in my sleep life", "Back when they offered a premium upgrade for $15, I bought it for the additional and higher quality sounds. When we were no longer hearing those sounds, I reached out for support. I received nothing but automated responses. No human contacted me after the multiple inquiries. Their premium page is no longer prominently displayed on their home page. I can only assume that's because they no longer offer it. That's not helping those of us who paid for the premium features.", "After searching for answers, I found them.

The company doesn't stand behind their product and, therefore, doesn't deserve it.", "I'm a new dad with twin infants and this skill was initially amazing for getting them to quiet down during feeding times. It was pretty simple: \"Open Sleep Sounds\", \"Play [Whatever I felt like in the moment.]", "But lately, there's about a 1 in 3 chance I will say \"Open Sleep Sounds\" and will be greeted with a five to ten minute monologue about new features (that doesn't actually enhance the experience I was already receiving), a tutorial on how to use a skill I've already been a steady or loyal user for several months, or (infuriatingly) a request that I navigate to this page to rate Sleep Sounds. Well, the coincidence of this request in the context of me trying to sooth a teething infant while Alexa's voice waking up the other twin is exactly what motivated me.", "The Sleep Sounds skill's competitors aren't just other white noise skills on the Alexa, but playlists I could easily generate from Spotify or Amazon Music. Or a cheap noise generator. Or a radio tuned in between stations. Or even a box fan or hair dryer. So it's a case of constantly attempting to \"improve\" the product actually gets in the way of the usefulness of the product when it's just as easy for me to never invoke it all if it doesn't work as expected.", "Perhaps if Invoked Apps did more to engage their users OUTSIDE of the Alexa... such as through social media or reaching out through Amazon's registered users, instead of making me wade through an interaction to actually get to the use case I want from it (basically... static).", "I have disabled the skill on Alexa and instead ordered a white noise machine for the living room. Is it hands free like the Sleep Sounds skill? No. Does it work basically the same way every time and doesn't blast me with product updates at 4 AM when I'm half asleep and my kids are fussy? No. And that alone makes it worth the money.", "Initially liked this skill, well enough to have gotten the premium membership, but it has been very lousy and pretty much unusable of late.  Initially, only issue seemed to be with playback of sounds randomly stopping.  Then it started to repeatedly \"forget\" my registration as a premium member.  Relinked my account several times, but skill would not retain the link more than a day and each time I would lose my custom sounds.  Tried contacting the developer, but they have failed to respond so I have requested a refund.  Will be looking for other solutions.", "I loved the app and paid for the premium membership which was fantastic-until one day I started getting the message that I had to be a premium member to use what I was wanting to listen to. I AM a premium member. I have tried to contact the seller, but have had no response at all from them. I am very disappointed because until that time I was using it every single night."]},

In this case, I had to ask the Echo device to stop, and then ask the Echo device to go back to the Sleep and Relaxation Sounds app and start over again. I'm not sure what I was doing wrong, if anything.", "The bottom line is the app is good, but if you want more sounds than the app has to offer for free, you have to purchase them.

At present you can get a lifetime membership for $19.95, a monthly membership at an unspecified price, or an annual membership for $9.95 or $8.

What's wrong with this picture: I'm all snuggled into bed after a long day. Alexa has tuned off my lights, set my alarm for the morning, and I'm ready to drift off to a restful sleep. As my final conscious act of the day, I ask Alexa to start Sleep Sounds, so I can fall asleep listening to waves crash upon the imaginary beach outside my bedroom window. The end to a perfect day. Instead, Alexa asks me to give the skill a five-star review, and proceeds to play a freakishly long advertisement pitching all of the bonus features of the paid app, including reciting its freakishly long web address.

Vault out of bed naked and break my neck in the dark rushing to find some way to write this address down before I forget it? Maybe, maybe that could be done. But I'm not considering it because I am so furious at the designer of this app for even considering playing a long-winded sales pitch an instant before I want to fall asleep (or, worse, plotting that I will buy this upgrade so that it doesn't happen again, which is simply evil), that what I really want to do is rip Alexa out of the wall, take it outside, and set it on fire on my patio which, sadly, isn't anywhere near the beach or the ocean waves that I was almost, ALMOST, about to be consumed by as I drifted off to sleep. What's worse, evil won out and I just spent an hour of my life that I will never get back trying to buy this upgrade, and can't figure out how. Evil Developers: If you are going to pull this type of BS, make it easy for consumers to sell out and buy your stuff.  Maybe tonight I will take a pen and paper with me to bed, write down the address Alexa shrieks at me, and then cry myself to sleep.  Cordially, Mark"]},

I am curious if Alexa will be checking up on me.  If I was to leave a 3 or 4 star rating, would she chastise me?  Since I did what she asked, is she smart enough to know not to ask me this again? I wonder if my AI companion will continue to ask me to do favors for her?  Does she have a sinister agenda, and will lead me down a dark and nefarious path, with her subtle suggestions?

Even though I paid for a membership, I'm frequently getting the long advertisement. The app cuts out several times during the night. Sometimes when asked to restart, it will play the very loud and very long advertisement. Recently I had to get up at 4am and unplug the speaker because the ad wouldn't stop.

Bless his heart, the seller was very responsive and helpful in the beginning but seems to have given up now that the problem has returned. I have tried everything and cannot get it to last the night more than occasionally; last night it stopped three times during the night and was off when I woke up in the morning.

I had inadvertently purchased premium twice and they refunded me without question. I am now creating my custom mixes and find it superior to their unpaid version which was very good and helped me sleep at night for the last year. I really like that I got in on the lifetime membership for one fee. I use this app it daily so it will absolutely pay off over time. For a long time I use my iPhone and many different apps to do what this app does. The only problem with the iPhone is that some of the app developers discontinue the version that I paid for and create a new app- then if you want to have the sounds back you must purchase the app all over again.  Then there are other apps abandoned by the develper are no longer supported and do not work on updated operating systems.
