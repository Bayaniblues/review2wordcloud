That's because XM suddenly decided to make us pay for using the Alexa skill when we already have a subscription to the service.

Total BS and greed - Goodbye XM!", "After quickly installing and signing into my Sirius account I was able to play music. The music would shut off after 2 minutes and 30 seconds of playing.

I can listen to maybe 2, 3, or 4 songs on a station before it comes on and says another device is being used to stream, but that's not the case. When I contacted support, they said disconnect and reconnect the skill (21st century version of \"did you turn it off then on again?\" LOL). But that is not fixing the problem. When it happens, it's always at the end of a song, and if I ask Alexa to start the station again, it's always the same song that last played that starts.

After many futile attempts to re-enable it, I realized that the app wouldn't play SiriusXM on one Alexa device if it had already been playing SiriusXM on a second device but paused.  The command \"stop\" (which I had been using) pauses the play but does not exit the app.  Since Sirius only allows streaming on one device at a time, this \"pause\" was apparently interpreted as Sirius already playing on another device.  The commands \"cancel\" or \"quit\" (or asking for weather or time) on the second Alexa device properly exits the SiriusXM app, clearing the way for the intended device to respond properly.  If this \"stop\" (= pause) vs. \"cancel\" (= exit) command issue is the simple explanation for the many customer reports of the app being \"not enabled\" when it already is, SiriusXM should consider making this command difference clear, up-front, on the main web page.", "Alexa says \u2026.

You can practically listen to anything you want to on SiriusXM. I normally listen to \"Prime Country\" (channel 58) and \"The Message. (channel 63) 2: It's not just in your car, it's also in your home! It's really easy to listen to SiriusXM anywhere, because of the Amazon Echo skill, and the mobile app, AND your car! 3: No commercials! You never have to listen to any annoying commercials on SiriusXM, which is the biggest reason I enjoy it.  Now, everything unfortunately has it's flaws, and the SiriusXM skill on the Amazon Echo is no exception. Here are some flaws I found in the skill: 1: It's pretty expensive. Right now, SiriusXM is offering a great deal for streaming on devices and SiriusXM in the car. It will cost you $8.33 a month for 12 months. Then, if you do not cancel your subscription at the end of this 12 month period, they will charge 20.99 a month for streaming plus car listening. It is definately a budget breaker. 2: The Echo doesn't have good satellite reception. Normally, it's a hit or miss scenario when your Echo is trying to connect to the SiriusXM satellite a couple miles in the air. Even when it does work, you will still experience interruptions occasionally. With your car, it's a different story. The satellite radio service will work even in your garage. 3: If you decide you don't want SiriusXM, you are bonded in a 12 month long contract. I'm warning you now: IF YOU SIGN UP FOR SIRIUSXM, YOU WILL BE BINDED TO A 12 MONTH LONG CONTRACT AND IF YOU CANCEL YOU WILL BE CHARGED A $50 CANCELLATION FEE, ACCORDING TO SIRIUSXM'S CUSTOMER AGREEMENT. Yes, you will be charged $50 if you decide you no longer want to pay for SiriusXM within your contract period. In general, I'd recommend getting just the car subscription, or just the streaming subscription. It's only $5 a month for 12 months. Of course, they raise the price to $15.99 after 12 months, but your contract with their company ends after 12 months. If you wish to continue to listen to SiriusXM, you will need to call them to renew your subscription. In general, it's a pretty good service.", "I am having the same problem this week...link disappears, and I have to disable and enable again - only to have the same situation the next day.

I've often driven around town wishing I had these stations in my house. Then, SIRIUS offered me a FREE Echo Dot, for adding a second subscription. I've only had the Dot for 2 days, but I absolutely love it! I can listen to all of my SIRIUS stations, PLUS my Amazon Prime music. And this little thing sounds like a stereo! But, it does so much more. I can ask about the weather, the time, play games, get jokes and words if the day. I can ask any question, pretty much like Google, and get an answer. It can be connected to a smart t.v. as well. So far, I'm very pleased with this little marvel!", "Seems like such a big company would have things together :/ hopefully it gets fixed soon.

Happy I did it & worth the extra couple $ a month (from 6 for $30 to 6 for $50). One thing that I don't like is that could easily be upgraded is identifying songs when alexa is asked. I like to listen to the 80s stuff, for example, and if I ask Alexa \"What's playing?\", it says \"80s on 8 from SiriusXM\". Thanks, I know that. You have the song/artist info there from sirius (as I see in my car) - so it would be nice if it would say the song & artist. When playing Amazon Prime music, it does this when you ask \"What's playing?\"", "So frustrated! My account has been linked for months and suddenly it unlinks.
