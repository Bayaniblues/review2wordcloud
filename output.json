Upon opening up you can ask Echo to list the sounds however she reads them so fast it can be difficult to keep track. I've compiled that full list below as of March 17, 2017. This skill needs some work as once you open it you need to issue it the direct name of the sound you want immediately it asks \"What can I do for you?\".

If you're willing to sit through all these sales pitches, you might find this app to be useful. If you are simply looking for the sounds (like it used to play without an upfront sales pitch), then you might want to rethink it.

It even says the original content would be free to the original users but nevertheless I get the message that the sound I have been listening to for weeks is now premium only.  Well I decide the promotional lifetime membership is worth it so I shell out the fifteen bucks and follow the instructions to register.  But then nothing happened.  I'm out $15 and don't even get what I paid for!  Used to be a good app and would even be worth the money, but as is it is a total rip off.  Will be emailing the developer for a refund.

Pros: it's free \ud83d\ude09, it has has all the convenience of Alexa apps...voice activation (don't have to get out of bed to turn it on), no need for another machine.  Cons: it runs on a thirty minute cycle with a pause in between.  The pause can be disturbing in the middle of the night.  Also, on more than one occasion it turned itself off in the middle of the night.  Not sure why.  Overall a good app, keeps my husband happy.", "When the premium membership option recently popped up for this app I decided to give it a try. At first the registration refused to work and I emailed support. They got back to me very quickly, suggesting I turn off a different app which interferes with the registration process. After this we were golden! The sounds are much better on the premium version and you can combine multiple sounds for your own mix. I had inadvertently purchased premium twice and they refunded me without question. I am now creating my custom mixes and find it superior to their unpaid version which was very good and helped me sleep at night for the last year. I really like that I got in on the lifetime membership for one fee. I use this app it daily so it will absolutely pay off over time. For a long time I use my iPhone and many different apps to do what this app does. The only problem with the iPhone is that some of the app developers discontinue the version that I paid for and create a new app- then if you want to have the sounds back you must purchase the app all over again.  Then there are other apps abandoned by the develper are no longer supported and do not work on updated operating systems. I am confident that this will not be the case with sleep relaxation sounds.", "I have tinnitus, so I need a constant white noise sound in order to fall asleep.

Then after I complained about it I was able to buy in again for another so called lifetime membership at the same price I paid before. Then after less than a month my membership was gone out of the blue. So now I am back to where I started with no ability to combine sounds and no additional sleep stories. I tried disabling the skill and re-enabling to no avail. I am irratted I paid now twice for a lifetime membership and got burned both times.

Best night sleep in my LIFE!!!!", "So happy to have found this app. Tried other sleeping aids like white noise and other non-Alexa based sound generators. Nothing really worked well. These work great. The plethora of sounds gives you something different to try and there\u2019s probably a favorite for every taste. I actually am able to sleep all night.
